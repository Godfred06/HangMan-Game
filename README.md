# HangMan-Game
This is a simplified version of the hangman game which gives the user a word to guess and a number of attempts to use to guess the word
User has 10 lives at the start of the game
If the user makes a guess of a letter which is not in the list of letters in the word to be guesssed, their lives are reduced by one.
The game ends when the user runs out of lives or when the user is able to successfully guess the hidden letter. 
Then the user is asked whether or not they want to play again
